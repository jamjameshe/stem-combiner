# stem-combiner

A small personal project I vibecpded for combining audio stems split from the same track. After splitting an audio track with an app like [stemroller](https://github.com/stemrollerapp/stemroller), upload the bass, drums, vocal ... stems into this app with customized volumes and play along with the combined audio! :)
