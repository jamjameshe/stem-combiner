# stem-combiner
A small project for combining audio stems split from the same track for playing together. After splitting an audio track with an app like [stemroller](https://github.com/stemrollerapp/stemroller), upload the bass, drums, vocal ... stems into this app with customized volumes and play along with the combined audio! :)
Since you upload your own files, everything runs locally in your browser.
